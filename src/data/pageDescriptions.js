  'CHETNA, an advanced successor of the <a href="https://carbonmonitor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon Monitor</a> framework, ' +
  'aims to leverage open-source data, artificial intelligence and satellite data to ' +
  'deliver near real-time and high spatial resolution CO<sub>2</sub> ' +
  'and air pollutants emission data across key urban sectors— <b>POWER</b>, <b>TRAFFIC</b>, ' +
  '<b>RESIDENTIAL</b>, <b>INDUSTRIAL</b> and <b>AVIATION</b> for 100+ Indian cities. </br> </br>' +
  'Updated monthly, CHETNA\'s emissions maps enable consistent monitoring ' +
  'of recent urban trends and inter-city comparisons. ' +
  'This granular and near real-time information is critical for capturing ' +
  'the dynamic nature of urban energy use and supporting data-driven ' +
  'climate and air quality policies. ',
  
  '/facts': 'India stands at the intersection of <b>RAPID URBANIZATION</b>, <b>RISING ENERGY DEMAND</b>, and <b>GROWING CLIMATE IMPACT</b>. ' +
    '<br> <br> Discover key facts about the country\'s energy use, emissions trends, and urban growth—highlighting the ' +
    'importance of sustainable development, the challenges of balancing growth with environment, '+
    'and the opportunity to reshape the future through data-driven action and climate-smart policies. ',
  '/methodology': 'Learn about our rigorous research methodology and data collection processes. We employ advanced analytical techniques and reliable data sources to ensure the accuracy and credibility of our research findings and policy recommendations.',
  '/people': 
  'CHETNA\'s partners bring together global and local expertise to transform ' +
  'how urban emissions are measured and understood in India ' +
  '—uniting a top climate science laboratory, a leading local research ' +
  'institute, and a technology company delivering novel data services for urban ' +
  'decarbonization. <br> <br> United by a shared mission, our team works across borders to produce ' +
  'high-resolution, city-level emissions data that supports evidence-based climate and ' +
  'air quality action—for both the <b>research community</b> and <b>local governments</b>.',
